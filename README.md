# IoT Sensor Network with React Native Firebase

## Introduction

Welcome to the IoT Sensor Network project! This project combines the power of IoT sensors with real-time data storage and visualization using Firebase and a React Native mobile app. The network of sensors, built using ESP8266 microcontrollers, collects data from the physical environment and uploads it to a Firebase Realtime Database. The React Native app provides a user-friendly interface to view and monitor the data from the sensors in real-time.

## Key Features

### 1. IoT Sensor Network
Deploy a network of IoT sensors using ESP8266 microcontrollers to collect environmental data.

### 2. Real-time Data Storage
Utilize Firebase Realtime Database to store sensor data instantly as it is collected by the sensors.

### 3. React Native App
Develop a mobile app using React Native to visualize and monitor the data from the IoT sensors.

### 4. Data Visualization
Display sensor data in real-time charts and graphs within the React Native app for easy interpretation.

### 5. Firebase Integration
Leverage Firebase authentication and real-time database features for seamless integration with the IoT sensor network.

### 6. Scalability
The architecture allows for easy scalability, enabling the addition of more sensors and users as needed.

## Advantages

- **Real-time Monitoring:** View sensor data in real-time on the React Native app, allowing for quick decision-making and analysis.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale the sensor network and the mobile app to accommodate more sensors and users.
- **Firebase Integration:** Benefit from Firebase's robust features for authentication, real-time data storage, and scalability.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Provide a user-friendly interface for users to visualize and interpret sensor data easily.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Access sensor data from anywhere using the React Native app, enabling remote monitoring and management.
